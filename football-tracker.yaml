# Ultralytics YOLO tracker settings for Football Analysis

# Tracker type: ByteTrack
# For a full list of ByteTrack arguments, see https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack/blob/main/tools/track.py
tracker_type: bytetrack

# --- Core ByteTrack Parameters ---

# track_high_thresh: High confidence threshold for matching. Detections with scores above this are considered high confidence.
# Default: 0.6
track_high_thresh: 0.5

# track_low_thresh: Low confidence threshold for re-matching. Detections below this are discarded.
# Default: 0.1
track_low_thresh: 0.1

# new_track_thresh: Threshold for creating a new track from a low-confidence detection if it can't be matched.
# This should be higher than track_low_thresh to avoid creating tracks from noise.
# Default: 0.7
new_track_thresh: 0.6

# track_buffer: The number of frames to keep a track alive without any matching detection.
# This is the MOST CRITICAL parameter for football analysis. Players are often occluded.
# A value of 120 means the tracker will "remember" a lost player for 120 frames (e.g., ~4 seconds at 30fps).
# Default: 30
track_buffer: 120

# match_thresh: The IOU (Intersection over Union) threshold for matching tracks with detections.
# Default: 0.8
match_thresh: 0.8
